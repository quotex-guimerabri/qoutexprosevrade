## What is Quotex Binary Trading?

Quotex is a binary options trading platform that allows traders to
speculate on the price movements of assets such as stocks, indices,
commodities, and currencies. Binary options are a type of financial
instrument that pays out a fixed amount if the underlying asset price
moves in the direction predicted by the trader, or nothing if it moves
in the opposite direction.
